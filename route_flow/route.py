"""
This is a class which keeps track of a route. In this work, a route is defined
as a policy over intersections in a network, where the most likely edge is
attempted to be taken, and with probbabilities associated with each edge, a
transition is stochastically taken. We present a formal correspondance between
a path (defined as an ordered list of nodes in a network) and a route (defined
as above).

Once this routing policy has been defined, the road network graph behaves like
a weighted random walk over a graph, ie. a Markov chain. See references for
theory behind how we calculate the link likelihood, P(visiting link | taking
route).
